# In python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipluted throughtout a program. A variable is created a moment you assign a value to it using the assingment operator (=).
#  python is dynamically typed language.

#  Rule of defining variables in python.
# Variables names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_)
#They can contain letters, numbers and underscores.
#Variables names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
#Avoid using Python keywords (e.g. if, for, while) as variable names.

# 34age = 4 #invalid
age = 32 #valid

# a$$ge = 69 #invaled
# _age = 47 #valid
a_b_c = "age" #valid
